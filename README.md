This repository contains my submissions to the Online Advanced Python Programming Course MOOC organized by the University of Helsinki. This course can be found at https://programming-24.mooc.fi/.

These projects make use of images produce by the University of Helsinki. These are 'robot.png', 'coin.png', 'door.png', 'monster.png'.
